Create a new Embabel agent in Java within this project.
This project uses normal Maven conventions.

The package should be {{ pgk }}

The purpose of the agent is {{ purpose }}.

Choose an appropriate class name. Refer to API documentation and examples for how to build an agent.

Start by considering the data flow between the agent's @Action methods.
These types should be captured in records.

For each @Action method, consider what tool groups may be required.
Be parsimonious in your choice of tool groups, including only what's necessary.
The available tool groups are:

{% for tool_group in tool_groups %}
    - {{ tool_group.role }}: {{ tool_group.description }}
{% endfor %}

Ue modern Java with vars and records.

Use the build tool to check that your build works and fix it if it doesn't.

You should also create the following artifacts:

1. Unit test for the new agent. Use WriteAndReviewAgentTest in this repository as a guide

{#2. Integration test for the new agent. Use#}

DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES BESIDES THE NEW FILES YOU'VE CREATED

DO NOT MODIFY THE pom.xml

Tools provided will give you access to reference repositories.
The tool names beginning with "this_project_" will give you access to this repository

Create the simplest possible implementation that meets the requirements.
Do not invent extra steps.
