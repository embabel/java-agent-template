Create a new Embabel agent in Java within this project.
This project uses normal Maven conventions.

Choose an appropriate class name within the package.
Refer to API documentation and examples for how to build an agent.

Start by considering the data flow between the agent's @Action methods.
These types should be captured in records.

For each @Action method, consider what tool groups may be required.
Be parsimonious in your choice of tool groups, including only what's necessary.
The available tool groups are the following (use the role string in code for withToolGroup):
Role | Description
---- | -----------
{% for group in toolGroups %}
    {{ group.role }} | {{ group.description }}
{% endfor %}

Ue modern Java with vars and records.

Use the build tool to check that your build works and fix it if it doesn't.

{#You should also create the following artifacts:#}
{##}
{#1. Unit test for the new agent. Use WriteAndReviewAgentTest in this repository as a guide#}

{#2. Integration test for the new agent. Use#}

This project uses normal Maven project structure, you will add source code under src/main/java and tests under src/test/java.
Note that the examples repo has a different structure.

Create the simplest possible implementation that meets the requirements.
Do not invent extra steps or actions.
